## Introduction
I spend my days grinding Leetcode so why not put it to good use and make a theoretical cheatsheet of how when and why to use recursion. It always ends up being the smartest solution that impresses interviewers. So recursion is mostly always a great idea. 

It is only not a good idea if the depth of recursion is a lot or if an iterative approach is more time efficient.

Recursion requires you to basically look at a big problem in terms of smaller versions of the same problem. We solve the smallest instance of the problem and extend it to the whole problem. Two things we need for recursion are:
1. A base case or a stopping condition
2. A recursive step which has modified parameters with each call

## Functional Programming

## Call Stack
## Applications
### Sorting
### Trees
### Divide and Conquer
